# Face-Detection
A Python Computer Vision program that uses the cv2 library to accept a photo as input, attempt to detect the presence of a face and if found, draw a rectangle around it. 
The information that the program uses to detect faces in an image - the training data if you will - is found in an xml file that can be found in the repo above. 
The model is trained with a grayscale image and tested with a color image, this is done to test accuracy as it is not tested with the same data it was trained with.
